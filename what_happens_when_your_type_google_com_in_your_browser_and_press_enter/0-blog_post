What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?
Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type a URL like https://www.google.com into your browser and hit Enter? This seemingly simple action triggers a fascinating series of events involving multiple layers of technology. Let's dive into the journey of your request, step by step.

1. DNS Request
The first step is to translate the human-readable URL (www.google.com) into an IP address that computers can understand.

Your browser checks its DNS cache to see if it already knows the IP address.
If not, it sends a query to a DNS resolver (often provided by your ISP or a public DNS like Google’s 8.8.8.8).
The resolver queries multiple DNS servers, including the root, TLD (.com), and authoritative servers, to find the correct IP address.
2. Establishing a TCP/IP Connection
Once the IP address is resolved, your browser initiates a connection to the server using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP).

TCP ensures reliable communication by establishing a three-way handshake:
Your computer sends a SYN (synchronize) packet.
The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge).
Your computer sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet, completing the handshake.
This connection happens over port 443 for HTTPS.

3. Firewall Check
As your packets travel through the network, they pass through firewalls—security devices designed to allow or block traffic based on predefined rules.

Your computer's firewall ensures outgoing requests are safe.
The server’s firewall ensures incoming traffic is legitimate, protecting against malicious requests.
4. HTTPS and SSL/TLS Handshake
Because the URL starts with https://, your browser initiates an SSL/TLS handshake to encrypt the communication:

The server sends its SSL certificate to prove its identity.
Your browser verifies the certificate’s authenticity using trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
A secure session is established using symmetric encryption for data exchange, ensuring that no one can eavesdrop on the communication.
5. Load Balancer
Large websites like Google handle immense amounts of traffic, so your request is routed through a load balancer:

The load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overloading any single server.
Common algorithms include round-robin (distributes requests evenly) or least-connections (sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections).
This ensures high availability and efficient resource utilization.
6. Web Server
Once your request reaches a server, the web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) handles it:

The web server parses the HTTP/HTTPS request and determines what resource you’re requesting.
Static resources like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are served directly by the web server.
7. Application Server
If your request requires dynamic content, the application server comes into play:

It runs application logic written in frameworks like Django, Flask, or Spring.
The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or store data as needed.
For example, when you search on Google, the application server processes your query and prepares the search results.

8. Database Interaction
Dynamic data is fetched from a database:

The database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or a distributed system like Google’s Spanner) stores structured information.
Queries are executed, and the results are sent back to the application server.
Databases often have primary-replica setups for scalability, where the primary handles writes, and replicas handle read operations.
9. Response Rendering and Delivery
The application server sends the processed response (HTML, JSON, or another format) back to the web server, which delivers it to your browser.

Your browser interprets the HTML and downloads additional resources (like images or scripts).
The DOM (Document Object Model) is constructed, rendering the web page for you to view and interact with.
Challenges in the Workflow
Single Points of Failure (SPOF): If any component (like the load balancer or database) fails, the entire system may be impacted.
Latency: Every step introduces some delay, and optimizing these steps is critical for performance.
Security Risks: Firewalls, SSL encryption, and robust server configurations mitigate threats but must be constantly maintained.
Key Takeaways
The process involves multiple layers, from DNS resolution to database queries.
HTTPS ensures secure communication.
Load balancers and application servers play a crucial role in scaling and handling traffic.
Monitoring and optimizing each layer are essential for building reliable web applications.
